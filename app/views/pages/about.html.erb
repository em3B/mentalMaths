      I created this app to help children strengthen their mental maths skills using the proven principles of the
      <strong>Singapore Maths</strong> approach.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      As a former primary school teacher with a <strong>Master’s in Childhood General and Childhood Special Education</strong>,
      I was trained in teaching Singapore-style maths — a highly effective method that helps children
      <em>visualise</em> numbers and truly understand mathematical relationships, rather than simply memorising facts.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Over time, I noticed a recurring challenge: while schools were eager to adopt the Singapore Maths method,
      there was often a gap in understanding. Many well-intentioned parents felt unsure about how to support their
      children at home, and even teachers were sometimes asked to teach the method without enough training to appreciate
      its full benefits.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Mental maths lies at the heart of the Singapore approach. Yet, in many classrooms, time pressures and curriculum
      demands can mean a focus on <em>breadth</em> rather than <em>depth</em> — leaving little room for students to
      develop confident mental calculation skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      After transitioning into a career in <strong>software engineering</strong>, I decided to combine my two passions —
      education and technology — to create a simple, focused tool for teachers, parents, and students. This app is designed
      to make mental maths practice both intuitive and effective, using the same visual reasoning strategies that make
      the Singapore method so powerful.
